- **Search Packages:** Search for specific packages by name.
- **Launch Apps:** Open an app on your device directly from the terminal.
- **Uninstall Apps:** Remove user or system apps (requires appropriate permissions).
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Menu-driven UI with clear options and feedback.

---

## Requirements 🛠️
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
- **ADB**: Installed and configured on your system.
- **USB Debugging**: Enabled on your Android device.

   cd adb-package-manager
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure ADB is installed and added to your system PATH:
   - Download from [Android Developer Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb).

   ```bash
   python adb_package_manager.py
   ```
2. Follow the menu prompts to interact with your connected Android device.

## Menu Options 📋

2. **Search for a Package**: Search for specific app packages by name and interact with them.
3. **Uninstall a Package**: Remove user apps by entering the package name.
4. **Uninstall a System App (user 0)**: Uninstall system apps for the default user (requires root or elevated privileges).
5. **About**: View information about the tool and developer.
6. **Exit**: Close the program.

## How It Works ⚙️
- **Device Detection**: The script uses `adb devices` to check connected devices.
- **Package Management**: Interacts with the Android package manager (`pm list packages`) via ADB commands.
- **App Actions**: Execute commands like `adb shell monkey` to launch apps and `adb uninstall` to remove them.
